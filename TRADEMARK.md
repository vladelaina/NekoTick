## 9. Third-Party API Credentials Policy

NekoTick includes API credentials for third-party services (such as GitHub OAuth) to enable sync functionality. These credentials are subject to the following usage policy:

### 9.1 Personal Use
If you are building NekoTick from source for **personal use only**, you **MAY** use the included API credentials.

### 9.2 Derivative Works and Redistribution
If you create a **derivative work**, **fork**, or **redistribute** a modified version of NekoTick, you **MUST**:
- ❌ **NOT** use the included NekoTick API credentials.
- ✅ Apply for and use your **own** API credentials from the respective service providers.
- ✅ Replace all credential values in the source code with your own.

### 9.3 Rationale
- The included credentials are registered under the NekoTick project and are subject to API quotas and usage monitoring.
- Derivative works using NekoTick's credentials may cause quota exhaustion or policy violations that affect the official NekoTick project.
- Using your own credentials ensures your project operates independently and responsibly.
